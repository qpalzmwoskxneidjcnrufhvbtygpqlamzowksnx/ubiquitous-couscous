So, before you hurriedly open to the app’s resources,  
your Spudkoo buddy isn’t quite ready yet.  
And we need your answers in order to figure out the best match for you. 
A test of 20 questions will be set before you to answer for the construction of your buddy. 
Answer them by typing the responses down and submitting them by either pressing [Enter] twice,
or the Enter button on the bottom of the screen.  This shouldn’t take forever, but make sure to take your time!
The personality of your buddy will be the hardest to change.
The tutorial section is now over.  Pressing the submit button again this time will begin the actual test.
